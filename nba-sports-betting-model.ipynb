I do not expect to out predict the lines given by the betting websites. However, the main goal of this project is to improve my understanding of regression analysis and get some practice with common practices. If you have any advice or improvements that you would have made please leave a comment and let me know. I'm always happy to get feedback. \n\n**TLDR:**  \n\"They are both high scoring teams, this game is going to be high\" - The data from this notebook shows that this is not an accurate measurement to predict the total points of an upcoming game. There is a lot of variance when it comes to the total points scored in a match. Even the betting lines are not highly accurate. \n\n### TABLE OF CONTENTS:\n* [Data Collection & Cleaning](#clean)\n* [Data Scraping](#scrape)\n* [Preprocessing & Notebook start](#pre)\n* [Data Insights & Feature Engineering](#feat)\n* [Models & Validation](#model)\n* [Results](#results)\n\n<sub> I tried changing many features/models/methods throughout this project and left a lot of stuff out of this notebook to make it clean, but I will make notes describing most of the things I tried.

This betting model will be referring to the most common over/under value, which is the total points (sum of both teams) scored at the end of the game. For example: if the  over/under value is 225 and you think the outcome will be lower than this, you will take the under. Then after the game team A scores 110 and team B scores 105 (110 + 105 = 115) you have won the bet because 115 is under 225. \n\n--------"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a name=\"clean\"> </a>\n# Data Collection & Cleaning :\n\n* Model data downloaded from Kaggle from [Nathan Lauga](https://www.kaggle.com/nathanlauga/nba-games). \n* Betting line history data scraped from [SDQL](https://sdql.com/) using [scrapy](https://scrapy.org/)\n\nSince the data provided was split up into a few different csv files, I had to do some matching and joining using pandas in order to add a few desired features like team records (wins, loses, gamesplayed).
